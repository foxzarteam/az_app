# App images (res/images)

Put these PNG files here to fix Flutter Web 404 (no more `assets/assets/` double path):

- `dashboard_hero.png` – Dashboard hero / welcome
- `kyc_success.png` – KYC success banner
- `personal_loan_share.png` – Personal loan share banner (optional)
- `share.png` – Lead form header (optional)

If you had them in `assets/images/`, copy them into this folder.
